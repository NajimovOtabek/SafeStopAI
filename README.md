# Vehicle SafeStop AI

**Intelligent Fail-Safe for the Future of Driving**

Vehicle SafeStop AI is a comprehensive, AI-driven emergency system designed to serve as a vehicle's ultimate safety net. It intelligently manages critical system failures to protect passengers, prevent secondary accidents, and provide OEMs with the technology needed to meet and exceed future safety standards.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The automotive industry is shifting from fail-safe to **fail-operational** systems. When a critical component (steering, braking, ECU) fails, current systems often default to abrupt stops, creating dangerous situations. SafeStop AI solves this by:

1.  **Detecting Faults**: Real-time health monitoring and redundancy checks.
2.  **Planning a Path**: AI-powered algorithms to find a safe stopping zone (e.g., road shoulder).
3.  **Executing Control**: Smooth, controlled deceleration and steering.
4.  **Communicating (V2X)**: Broadcasting alerts to nearby vehicles and infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
